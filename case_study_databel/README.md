# Power BI Customer Churn Analysis for Databel

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of customer churn for the telecommunications company, Databel. The primary objective was to understand the drivers behind a **26.86% churn rate** and to provide actionable, data-driven strategies to improve customer retention.

The entire analysis was conducted using Microsoft Power BI, from data cleaning and transformation to the creation of an interactive, multi-page dashboard designed for stakeholder review, including a dedicated executive summary page.

## Dashboard Preview

Below is a screenshot of the main overview page of the dashboard.



## Key Findings

The analysis of customer behavior revealed that the churn rate is driven by specific, identifiable factors:

* **Contract & Payment Impact:** A key high-churn segment consists of customers on **Month-to-Month contracts** who use **Direct Debit**. This group also makes a significantly high number of customer service calls, suggesting a link between short-term contracts, potential payment issues, and dissatisfaction.

* **Unused Premium Services:** The single highest churn rate **(71.19%)** is found among customers who subscribe to an International Plan but have no international activity. This indicates customers are paying for a service they don't use, leading to a perception of poor value.

* **Competitive Pressure:** A primary driver for churn is related to competitor actions, indicating that customers are actively being offered or are seeking more attractive alternatives in the market.

* **The California Anomaly:** California has one of the highest churn rates but, unlike other high-churn segments, these customers do not make more service calls. This suggests the churn drivers in California are unique and likely related to local competition or network quality rather than service issues.

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on these findings, the following actions are recommended for Databel:

1.  **Incentivize Annual Contracts:** Launch a marketing campaign to migrate "Month-to-Month" customers to longer-term contracts by offering loyalty benefits or discounts.
2.  **Audit Unused Premium Services:** Proactively contact customers with an International Plan but no international activity. Suggesting they remove the unused service would reduce their bill and significantly increase satisfaction.
3.  **Conduct Competitive Analysis:** Perform a thorough review of competitor offerings to ensure Databel's value propositions remain attractive and competitive.
4.  **Launch a Targeted California Strategy:** Initiate a region-specific investigation into the unique drivers of churn in California, focusing on local competitor offers, network quality, and pricing.
