### 1. How to Download

The `.pbip` project files in this repository may not download correctly if you click them individually (you will get an empty file).

To get all the complete, working projects at once, you **must** download the entire repository as a ZIP:

1.  Click the green `<> Code` button at the top of this page.
2.  Select `Download ZIP` from the dropdown menu.

This will download a single file (`dashboards-powerbi-main.zip`) containing all the project folders.

### 2. How to Unzip (To Fix "Path Too Long" Error)

After downloading, you **must** unzip the file to a location with a very short path.

If you try to unzip it in your `Downloads` or `Documents` folder, you will likely get a **"path too long" error**. This happens because `.pbip` projects contain many nested folders.

**Simple Solution:**

1.  Find the downloaded `dashboards-powerbi-main.zip` file.
2.  Move it directly to your **`C:\`** drive.
3.  **Right-click** the file and "Extract All..." from there.

This will create a short path like `C:\dashboards-powerbi-main\`, which will work correctly.
